* Nothing much to see here.  This is just a *sample* **repository** so I can get a feel for how _*GitHub*_ works.

* This is the updated README file for repo0.
* With a <strike>second</strike> third line.

Do relative links work?  [foo.html](repo0/foo.html)  No.

Trying several kinds of links:

- This file: [https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/repo0/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/repo0/blob/master/README.md)
- Full URL: [https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/repo0/blob/master/foo.html](https://github.com/Keith-S-Thompson/repo0/blob/master/foo.html)
- Simple relative file name: [foo.html](foo.html)
